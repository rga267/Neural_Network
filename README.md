# Neural_Network
A 2 Layer Neural Network for predicting XOR

This program predicts the Bitwise XOR output of a given input.
Training consists of gradient descent with two activations functions. One being the sigmoid function and the second is the tanh function. Cross-entropy is used as the loss function.
